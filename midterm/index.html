                    The cats have been the closest and favorite among the human beings for thousands of years. 
                    They are very independent yet loving and mysterious. Dogs are dependent most part of the time
                     and needy in terms of companionship, while cats have independence in spending quality time 
                     by themselves but playtime or deep emotional bonding goes hand in hand with owners.
                      The daily routine of a pet cat follows its owners according to its own whims and fancies,
                       with a touch of innate curiosity making every day adventure. Cats thrive on routine, 
                       and once they establish a daily schedule, they tend to stick to it. Their day usually
                        consists of eating, sleeping, grooming, playing, and exploring their surroundings. 
                        The most common characteristic of a cat's lifestyle would be its sleep. On average, 
                        a cat sleeps 12-16 hours a day, while some sleep 20 hours or more! Cats are crepuscular
                         animals, so they are most active in the early morning and at dusk. They will take 
                         about 15 to 18 hours a day snoozing in good, warm, and comfortable areas, where they
                          curl up under the sun or onto some soft cushions that allow them to stretch out and
                           catch some peaceful sleep. Another is that they are known for continually preferring 
                           to groom themselves. 30-50% of their awake hours are spent licking up most pots, 
                           which helps in thermoregulation.
