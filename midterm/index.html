                    Cats have been beloved companions to humans for centuries, offering a unique
                     blend of independence, affection, and mystery. Unlike dogs, which 
                     often crave constant interaction, cats have a distinct lifestyle
                      that is a mix of solitude, playfulness, and deep emotional connections
                       with their owners. A pet cat’s life revolves around routines, personal 
                       preferences, and an innate curiosity that makes every day an adventure.
                        Cats thrive on routine, and once they establish a daily schedule, they 
                        tend to stick to it. Their day usually consists of eating, sleeping,
                         grooming, playing, and exploring their surroundings. One of the most
                        well-known traits of a cat's lifestyle is its love for sleep.
                        On average, a cat sleeps between 12 to 16 hours a day, with some even
                          sleeping up to 20 hours! Cats are crepuscular animals, meaning they 
                         are most active during dawn and dusk. They spend their afternoons 
                         dozing in warm, comfortable spots, often curling up in sunbeams or finding 
                         soft cushions where they can stretch and nap peacefully. Cats are also known
                          for their meticulous grooming habits. They spend 30-50% of their waking hours
                          licking their fur, which helps regulate body temperature, remove dirt, and 
                         keep their coats smooth and free from tangles. Grooming also serves as a 
                            stress-relief mechanism and a bonding activity between cats and their owners.
                             If a cat licks its human, it is often a sign of affection and trust. 
                             When it comes to eating, cats have unique dietary needs and can be quit
                             e particular about their food.
